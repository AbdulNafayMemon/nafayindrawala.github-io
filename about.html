        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at IBA Karachi, with an expected graduation in 2026. My academic journey has been driven by a strong passion for technology and a desire to solve complex problems through innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>Alongside my studies, I have over six years of experience in the logistics industry, working with Allied Logistics Services. This experience has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of business operations, project management, and client relations. I have successfully balanced my academic commitments with my professional responsibilities, demonstrating my ability to manage multiple priorities effectively.</p>
        <p>At the core of my professional identity is a commitment to continuous learning and growth. I am particularly interested in machine learning and data analysis, and I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. My involvement in initiatives like PSUP (Pakistani Students United for Palestine) reflects my dedication to using my skills for the greater good.</p>
